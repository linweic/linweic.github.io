This site is a working notebook of short, practical posts:

- Systems and reliability notes (what failed, how I debugged it, why it stuck)
- Performance and observability write-ups with reproducible steps
- Lightweight ML-in-production lessons (validation, drift, and ownership)

My goal is to make each post useful in under five minutes, with enough detail to implement the idea in your own stack. If you’re hiring or collaborating, I’d be happy to chat.
