## About

I’m Linwei Chen (陈霖炜), an engineer who likes dependable systems, fast feedback loops, and writing that saves other engineers time.

- **Focus**: backend/platform, data/ML integration, infra reliability, and developer experience.
- **Strengths**: diagnosing bottlenecks, clarifying requirements, and delivering incremental improvements that add up.
- **Working style**: small prototypes → production rollout with observability, docs, and guardrails.

I’m building this site as a portfolio of short, high-signal posts and project notes that reflect how I think and work. If my work looks relevant, I’d love to connect.
