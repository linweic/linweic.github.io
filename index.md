## Hi, I’m Linwei — I build reliable systems and useful tools

I’m an engineer focused on pragmatic impact: shipping production-grade systems, improving developer workflows, and applying ML where it creates leverage.

- **What I’m good at**: backend/platform, data/ML integration, performance tuning, and clear writing.
- **What I enjoy**: turning messy systems into dependable ones, and explaining why the changes matter.
- **Currently**: exploring roles where I can own 0→1 projects or scale 1→N.

### Selected writing
I publish concise, practical posts designed for engineers and hiring managers:
- Coming soon: benchmarking notes, system design walkthroughs, and ML-in-production case studies.

### Projects
- Short case studies on distributed jobs, tracing, and ML features are in progress.

If you’re hiring or collaborating, feel free to reach out.
